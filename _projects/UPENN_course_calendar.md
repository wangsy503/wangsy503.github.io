## Main Features

Extract course and date information from UPenn course selection page and export as an iCalendar file.

## Description

The course selection page for University of Pennsylvania does not directly provide a way to export the courses into your own calendar. Using this extension, users can go to their primary cart of courses and download the generated course schedule calendar file with 1-click.

## Story behind the project

Every semester, I found myself spending excessive time manually inputting classes from my schedule into my Google calendar. I wondered if there was a more efficient way to handle this. My goal was to create a solution that users could easily access without any technical know-how or familiarity with GitHub. This led me to the idea of creating a browser plugin.

I consulted ChatGPT with my plugin requirements. In no time, it provided me with a foundational structure for a browser plugin and outlined the core logic behind the desired functionality. With the guidance from ChatGPT and several hours of research, testing, and debugging, the first version of the UPENN Course Calendar was born within 8 hours. I feel fortunate to be in an era where AI can assist in programming.

The following day, I enlisted a few friends from Penn to test the plugin. They identified a few bugs, like the confusion between 12pm and 24pm, which I promptly addressed. However, since the plugin wasn't officially published yet, they had to access it through developer mode in their browsers via my GitHub. This inspired me to streamline the process. I also ventured into designing promotional materials in Adobe Illustrator and even launched a YouTube video to showcase the plugin.

After a brief waiting period, I was thrilled to receive confirmation that my plugin was live on the Chrome Plugin Store! You can find it by searching for "UPENN Course Calendar" or by following this [link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/upenn-course-calendar/aiofdhjednbbfajbcpmgbblpljncfnkh). Give it a whirl!
